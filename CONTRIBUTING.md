# Contributing to E-commerce Analytics Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-platform/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-platform/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Development Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ecommerce-analytics-platform.git
   cd ecommerce-analytics-platform
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment**
   ```bash
   cd api
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start local development environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   pytest test_main.py -v
   ```

## Code Style

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting
- Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) for import sorting
- Use [pylint](https://pylint.org/) for linting

```bash
# Format code
black api/
isort api/

# Lint code
pylint api/
```

### Terraform Code Style

- Follow [Terraform Style Guide](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/syntax/style.html)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic
- Use variables for reusable values

### Documentation

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document new API endpoints

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all new functions and classes
- Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints end-to-end
- Test infrastructure deployment
- Verify security configurations

### Performance Tests

- Include load tests for API endpoints
- Monitor resource utilization
- Document performance benchmarks

## Security Considerations
